Notes:

Tool used Vite:

> . App.jsx defines a react component with the name App.
> . The command on the final line of file main.jsx renders its contents into the div-element, defined in the file index.html, having the id value 'root'.
> // ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)

> . Note By default, the file index.html doesn't contain any HTML markup that is visible to us in the browser:
> . When using React all content that needs to be rendered is usually defined as react components.

> . First rule in frontend web development - keep the console open all the time.

> . It is possible to render Dynamic content inside a component.
