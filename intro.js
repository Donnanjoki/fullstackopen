PART 0: INTRO TO WEB DEVELOPMENT

### First rule of web development ###

>.Always keep the Developer Console Open on your web browser.


### Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) GET ###

>. The server and the web browser communicate with each other using the HTTP protocol.
The network tab shows how the browser and server communicate. 

>. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning the server does not keep any data(state) between two requests.

>.So when a page is open, the following chain of events occurs.
      1]] First, the browser sends a HTTP GET request to the server to fetch the HTML code of the page.
      2]] If there is an image in the page, the img tag in the html prompts the browser to fetch the image
      3]] The browser then renders the HTML page and the image on the screen
      4]] Note, the HTML page begins to render before the image has been fetched from the server


### Traditional Web Applications ###

>. In traditional web applications, the browser is dubbed "dumb". It only fetchesHTML data from the server and all the application
logic is on the server. A server can be created using JavaSpring, Python Flask or Ruby on Rails.


### Event handlers and Callback functions ###

>. Event handler functions are called callback functions. The application does not invoke the function itself, but the runtime environment,
the browser, invokes the function at the appropriate time when the event has occurred.


### Document Object Model or DOM ###
